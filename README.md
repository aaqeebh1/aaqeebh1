## Projects
- [School Of Code Final Project](https://github.com/aaqeebh1/bc16-final-projects-team-ctrl-alt-elite):
Our team was tasked by the Director of Communications of the West Midlands Combined Authority to
create a detailed and high-level view of scheduled activities across departments. Our solution was made
using ReactJS with Vite for its superior performance, offering faster builds and hot module replacement,
and for its ease of use, providing a streamlined development experience with modern tooling. Using an
agile workflow, we managed version control with GitHub, employed Husky and Snyk for automated tasks
and security, and tracked progress via Trello's ticketing system. This tool enhances strategic decisionmaking and resource management.

- [Anime Search Website](https://github.com/aaqeebh1/aaqeeb-internship):
A responsive Anime search website built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS. Utilizes the Jikan API to fetch and display data, and features React Router, React Hooks, and a loading state.


- [FrontEndSimplified Final Project](https://github.com/aaqeebh1/aaqeeb-internship):
 An NFT marketplace built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, and REST APIs. The project features a responsive design and simulates a real-world environment by utilizing Git and GitHub for pull requests.
